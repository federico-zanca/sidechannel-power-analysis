        \begin{itemize}
            \item Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer an alternative to traditional Template Attacks.
            \item Instead of calculating probabilities, ML uses a \textbf{classification step} to identify the secret information
            \item A key advantage: ML provides a \textbf{nonparametric and data-driven approach}, removing assumptions about the statistical distribution of the leakage (like the Gaussian assumption in TAs)
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Support Vector Machines (SVMs)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SVMs are a widely used and effective choice for profiled side-channel attacks.
            \item Their goal is to find an optimal hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes (e.g., traces for key bit '0' vs. key bit '1')
            \item This hyperplane acts as a decision boundary
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{block}{Profiling Phase (Training)}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using the controlled device, the attacker collects many labeled side-channel traces (traces paired with their known key bit values)
            \item The SVM algorithm learns from this labeled data to compute the optimal hyperplane
            \item This process involves mapping the traces into a (potentially) higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable, making it easier to find the separating hyperplane
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\frametitle{Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Detailed Flow}
    \begin{block}{Classification Phase}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A new, unlabeled side-channel trace is acquired from the target device (where the key is unknown)
            \item This new trace is then input into the trained SVM model
            \item The SVM classifies the trace by determining which side of the learned hyperplane it falls on, thereby predicting the most likely key bit value
        \end{itemize}
